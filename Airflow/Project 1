# Healthcare Dataset Stroke Analysis with Apache Airflow
# Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze and process healthcare data, specifically focused on stroke-related insights, by leveraging Apache Airflow for orchestration. The dataset includes patient information, such as demographics, medical history, and other attributes, to predict and understand stroke patterns. Airflow is used to automate data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and analytics workflows efficiently.

3 Key Objectives:
Automate Data Pipeline: Develop a robust pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and transforming the healthcare dataset.
Enhance Data Quality: Ensure data integrity by handling missing values, inconsistent data, and duplicates.
Generate Insights: Extract meaningful statistics and predictions to support healthcare decisions regarding stroke prevention and treatment.
Scalable Workflow: Create a modular, scalable, and maintainable pipeline for future healthcare analytics use cases.
Workflow Structure:
DAG Setup:

The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines the sequence of tasks for the ETL pipeline.
The DAG is scheduled to run periodically or on-demand, ensuring real-time data updates.
Tasks in the DAG:

Extract: Load the dataset (e.g., healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv) from a local directory, cloud storage, or database.
Transform: Clean and preprocess the data, including:
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing numerical fields.
Load: Store the processed data into a database or analytics platform.
Analyze: Perform basic statistical analysis or predictive modeling to identify stroke risk factors.
Report Generation: Generate summary reports and visualizations for stakeholders.
Error Handling:

Incorporates retry mechanisms for failed tasks and sends notifications if errors occur.
Validates the presence of input data before proceeding with subsequent steps.
Key Airflow Components:

Operators: PythonOperator, BashOperator, and EmailOperator are used for data processing, script execution, and notifications.
Sensors: FileSensor ensures the presence of the dataset before starting the workflow.
Trigger Rules: Manages dependencies between tasks to ensure reliable execution.
Challenges Addressed:
Data Availability: The workflow includes a validation step to ensure the dataset is present before processing.
Scalability: The modular design allows adding new tasks, such as advanced ML models or data sources, with minimal changes.
Automation: Eliminates manual intervention by automating repetitive data processing tasks.
Future Enhancements:
Integrate a real-time data pipeline using streaming tools like Kafka.
Extend the analysis to predict other health-related risks.
Deploy the results to a dashboard for real-time monitoring and visualization.
